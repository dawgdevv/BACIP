# 📚 BACIP – Blockchain Academic Credential Interoperability Protocol

BACIP is a blockchain-based protocol for issuing, managing, and verifying academic credentials in a secure, decentralized, and globally interoperable manner. It combats academic fraud and empowers students and institutions with ownership, control, and privacy of educational data.

## 🔧 Specifications & Technologies Used

### 🔐 Core Technologies

- **Blockchain Architecture**: Public Ethereum-compatible chain (L2 or zkEVM-based)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts for automation of credential lifecycle
- **zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine)**: Enables private verifications without disclosing sensitive data
- **Consensus Protocol**: Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) or any Ethereum-compatible consensus
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Data Encryption**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Digital Identity**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- **Credential Format**: JSON-LD for semantic metadata

### 📡 Communication

- **APIs**: RESTful (`/issueCredential`, `/verifyCredential`, `/revokeCredential`)
- **Data Exchange**: JSON schema-based interactions

### 🔏 Security & Privacy

- **Signature Algorithms**: ECDSA (ES256) and EdDSA (Ed25519)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification
- **GDPR Compliance**: Includes consent management and right to be forgotten

## ⚙️ How BACIP Works

### 📥 Credential Issuance

1. University creates a credential (degree, certificate, etc.).
2. Data is encrypted using AES and structured using JSON-LD.
3. Encrypted data is stored on IPFS, and a reference hash is stored on-chain.
4. A smart contract logs issuance on a public blockchain with verifiable metadata.

### ✅ Credential Verification

1. Verifier queries the smart contract using a REST API.
2. zkEVM ensures credential validity without revealing full data.
3. Verification is cryptographically guaranteed via on-chain proof and digital signature.

### 🔄 Credential Revocation

- A dedicated smart contract tracks revoked UUIDs.
- Anyone can check revocation status via `/isRevoked` endpoint in real time.

## 🧠 Core Principles

1. **Interoperability** – Open standards ensure global compatibility.
2. **Security** – AES encryption, zk-proofs, and immutability.
3. **Privacy** – Student-controlled access to academic data.
4. **Transparency** – Public audit trails with traceability.
5. **Scalability** – Built on efficient Ethereum-compatible chains.
6. **Usability** – Designed for institutions, employers, and students.
7. **Adaptability** – Modular architecture for future upgrades.
8. **Sustainability** – Lightweight, energy-efficient, and cost-effective.
